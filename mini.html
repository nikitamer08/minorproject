            <p>The Taj Mahal (/'Crown of the Palace') is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of
                the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah
                Jahan (r. 1628-1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of
                Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a
                mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>

            <h1 id="indiagate">India Gate</h1>
            <p> The India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Rajpath
                on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called duty path. It stands as a
                memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World
                War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the
                Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and
                officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate
                evokes the architectural style of the memorial arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is
                often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.</p>

            <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that
                served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the
                Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and
                white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The
                fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace
                architecture with Indian traditions.</p>

            <p> The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Bahai House of Worship that was dedicated in December
                1986. Notable for its lotuslike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all other
                Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other
                qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of
                three to form nine sides,[1] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over
                34 meters[1] and a capacity of 1,300 people.[2] The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural
                awards[3][4] and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.</p>

            <p>

                The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms
                part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi’s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by
                the Tomar Rajputs.[3] It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi,
                India.[4][5] It is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city, mostly built between 1199 and
                1220.[6][7][4]

                It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190, which was
                constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.[8] The surfaces of both are
                elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns.

            <h1 id="hawamahal">Hawa Mahal</h1>
            <p> The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the
                edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

                The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
                Singh, the founder of the city of Jaipur, India.[1] He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri
                Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

                It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small
                windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice
                design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below
                without being seen. </p>
